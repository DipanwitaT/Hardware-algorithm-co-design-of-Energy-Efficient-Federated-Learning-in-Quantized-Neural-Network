# Hardware-algorithm-co-design-of-Energy-Efficient-Federated-Learning-in-Quantized-Neural-Network
Setup:
You need a Linux platform to use some of the libraries, such as pyRAPL. Some libraries will not work in virtual machine-based Linux. It would help if you had the Linux based PC to run this experiment.
